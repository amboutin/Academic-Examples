The Following Programs and what they do:

Elementary Arithmetic -  Program prompts the user for two values, then displays their sum, 
  difference, product, and quotient with remainder.

Fibonacci Numbers - Program greets the user, then takes in their desired number 
  of terms and displays that many numbers in the Fibonacci numbers sequence.

Composite Numbers -  Prompts user for a number of composite numbers to print,
  then prints more in pages until the max number of 400 is reached.
  
Sorting Random Numbers -  Fills an array with user defined number of random values and prints it.
  Then Bubble sorts the array from largest to smallest, and prints the median and the whole array.
  
Designing low-level I/O Procedures - Program that gets ten values, max of 32-bits, from user and displays them, 
  their sum, and their average. In doing this, it takes in values as strings, convert to integers for arithmetic operations,
  and then converts them back into strings for printing to screen.
